# Read the Bee for Free

a really stupid way to steal articles from paywalled news websites.

it uses wget, or urllib to fetch these and then display them in your web browser. Written in Python, its a simple little gui that you paste the urls into and then it spawns them up. 

[Linux standalone executable](apollo.effendi.me/web/read_the_bee)

[Windows .exe](apollo.effendi.me/web/read_the_bee.exe)

or run `read_the_bee.py` 

## to build the exe:

`pyinstaller --onefile read_the_bee.py`

## to use

copy the url of the article you want to read into the line field.

Click `Download and Read` and it will open in your web browser!
